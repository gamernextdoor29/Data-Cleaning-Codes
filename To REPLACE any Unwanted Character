# understanding r'[^\d.]'
# as you know r  makes it will allow code \d
# ^ this means Not or Expect

# so combined means replace everything that is Not a number and Not a decimal with ''
#regex = False #means look for the exact string you typed. best to remove commas
#regex = True #means look for a pattern described by your symbol. used for shortcuts like \d
